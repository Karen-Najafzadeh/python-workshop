# python-workshop

This repository is dedicated to my python workshop Where I was teaching Python for 2 semesters in Kharazmi university as a lecturer (2022-2023). It contains my handout pdfs and recorded sessions of the workshop and all the examples and practices covered and explained during the classes.
The main lanuage of the course was Persian, so if you don't speak the language you might not be able to use the videos and handouts. But still if you are a beginner, or intermediate I encourage you too take a look at the python files, surely you can find some interesting there.
I hope you can find somthing here that may be of your use.
